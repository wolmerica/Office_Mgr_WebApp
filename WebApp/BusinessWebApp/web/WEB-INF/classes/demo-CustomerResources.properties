neuter.facts.title=CATSTRATION, THE FACTS
neuter.facts.date=Date:
neuter.facts.page=2
neuter.facts.page1.count=7
neuter.facts.page1.section1=Castration, orchidectomy, neutering of the male is the surgical removal of the testicles and associated tissue.  The ideal time for castration surgery is at the time the cat or dog has acquired the masculine characteristics typical for the breed.  Most cats and dogs are approximately 9 months of age when this maturation has occurred.  Although for a few specific breeds and some individuals this age may be younger or older.
neuter.facts.page1.section2=The favorable aspects of castration include limiting the pet population by preventing happenstance mating; your pet will not be subjected to the seasonal mating call, and a reduced possibility of reproductive diseases.
neuter.facts.page1.section3=Your pet will not experience personality changes after surgery.  Most personalities are established at a very young age and surgical procedures have little influence.
neuter.facts.page1.section4=The castrated pet will experience a change in metabolism, a slowing down of the process.  The slowed metabolism may add up to excess weight.  To counter balance the slowed metabolism a number of steps should be taken, individually or in combination.  These steps include a reduced total food volume intake (including treats), possibly changing to a diet dog food (the total volume of food usually is constant but the caloric content is greatly reduced), and a program of regular increased exercise.
neuter.facts.page1.section5=Preparation for the surgery is usually begun the day before by the owner.  The patient begins a fast the afternoon prior to the surgery.  Provide water or milk for the pet, but all solid foods should be withheld.
neuter.facts.page1.section6=Upon arriving at the clinic the patient will be given a complete physical by the admitting Doctor.  The physical will include a check of the heart, lungs, a discussion of the general health observed by the owner and present diet.  The findings of the examination will allow the Doctor to determine present health and surgical risk.  At the time of the physical exam any needed vaccinations will be given.  Vaccinations help protect your pet by providing strong resistance to disease.  A preanesthetic tranquilizer will also be given to reduce the anxiety of the pet and to facilitate easier handling.
neuter.facts.page1.section7=Surgical preparation begins by shaving hair from the fore and rear legs.  A clear field surrounding the site of intravenous anesthetic injection is necessary.  As the effects of the injectable anesthetic begin to deepen, the patient is further prepared for surgery.  Gas anesthesia may also be given.  The surgical site is prepared by saving all hair from the abdominal and inguinal area.  The field is the thoroughly scrubbed with a disinfectant soap and a surgical disinfectant is applied.
neuter.facts.page2.count=4
neuter.facts.page2.section1=An incision is made through the skin over each testicle or at the median raphe.  Each testicle and associated tissue is then surgically removed.  The incision is then sutured and anesthesia is ended.  During the surgical procedure the patients' lung and heart functions are constantly monitored.
neuter.facts.page2.section2=The patient is allowed to recover in the confines of a kennel.  For the first few hours after surgery patients are still sedated.  Most patients are discharged 4 to 6 hours after surgery.
neuter.facts.page2.section3=Post operative instructions follow common sense.  Begin to control the diet as previously mentioned to prevent excessive weight gain.  Most patients will gradually come to a level of activity comfortable for their own desires.  Excessive attention to the surgical site should be gently discouraged.  Stitches will be removed in approximately seven days after the surgery.
neuter.facts.page2.section4=If you have any questions, please feel free to call the office.

new.pet.page1.section13=Females (either puppy or kitten should be spayed at 5 to 6 months of age, prior to the first heat cycle; or when the adult canine teeth begin to replace the "baby" teeth.  An ovariohysterectomy (OHE, spay) is complete surgical removal of the ovaries and the uterus.  Neutering of the female greatly reduces the incidence of mammary tumors in the aged adult.
new.pet.page1.section14=Males (either puppy or kitten) should be castrated at 9 months of age.  An orchidectomy (castration) is the complete removeal of the testes.  Neutering of the male reduces the incidence of testicular tumors in the aged adult.

# Puppy Proof Information.
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
puppy.proof.title=Puppy Proof Your Home
puppy.proof.date=Date:
puppy.proof.page=1
puppy.proof.page1.count=16
puppy.proof.page1.section1=Many new puppies are injured or harmed because their owners are not aware of their habits or how curious they are.  But if you imagine your home through the eyes of the puppy, you may notice many seemingly harmless household items that can cause unfortunate problems.
puppy.proof.page1.section2=Here are some suggestions to help you puppy-proof your home:
puppy.proof.page1.section3=1. Don't leave cigarette butts in ash trays where the puppy can get to them.  If eaten, cigarette butts can lead to nicotine poisoning.
puppy.proof.page1.section4=2. Secure electric cords to the baseboards or make them inaccessible.  They make perfect chew toys but can cause harmful electric shock burns and even death.
puppy.proof.page1.section5=3. Keep Christmas decorations above the dog's reach level.  Crushed glass Christmas balls can result in nasty cuts.
puppy.proof.page1.section6=4. Never allow burning candles to be accessible to pups.  The brightness of the flame will attract them.
puppy.proof.page1.section7=5. Keep medication bottles out of the puppy's way.  Childproof containers are not enough where puppies are concerned.
puppy.proof.page1.section8=6. Always keep the toilet lid down if you use toilet bowl cleaners.  They are often strongly alkaline and tempting for a puppy to drink.
puppy.proof.page1.section9=7. Keep cellar doors and upper story windows closed.  A curious puppy is as vulnerable as a young child.
puppy.proof.page1.section10=8. Don't invite other pets to your house until your puppy is fully vaccinated.  A puppy's resistance to infection is lower than an adult dog's until about 16 weeks of age.
puppy.proof.page1.section11=9. Dispose of chicken and turkey bones in a puppy proof manner.  Puppies like these bones and will search through the trash to get them.
puppy.proof.page1.section12=10. Don't leave needles or pins out where the puppy can get to them.  They often swallow them.
puppy.proof.page1.section13=11. Be certain anti-freeze is out of reach and any drippings are cleaned up completely.  For some reason puppies are attracted to its scent.  Anti-freeze is highly toxic.
puppy.proof.page1.section14=12. Use pesticides with caution.  Hanging strips, fly paper and other exposed toxins must be kept out of reach.
puppy.proof.page1.section15=13. Avoid using flea collars, flea dips and certain other preparations until your puppy is at least 15 weeks old.  Find out the limitations of these products before applying them.
puppy.proof.page1.section16=14. Keep your puppy away from toxic plants.  The Rhododendron, Japanese Yew, Lily of the Valley as well as peach and cherry pits can cause problems if eaten.

spay.facts.title=SPAYING, THE FACTS
spay.facts.date=Date:
spay.facts.page=2
spay.facts.page1.count=7
spay.facts.page1.section1=Spay, ovariohysterectomy, OHE, neutering of the female is the surgical removal of the ovaries, ulcrine horns, associated blood vessels, and fatty tissue.  The ideal time for spay surgery is at the time the cat or dog has acquired the feminine characteristics type for the breed.  Most cats and dogs are approximately 6 months of age when this maturation has occurred and as yet have not experienced their first estrus.  Although for a few specific breeds and some individuals this age may be younger or older.
spay.facts.page1.section2=The favorable aspects of spaying include limiting the pet population by preventing the birth of additional puppies and kittens; your pet will not be subjected to the seasonal estrus cycle, and a reduced possibility of mammary tumors and reproductive diseases.
spay.facts.page1.section3=Your pet will not experience personality changes after surgery.  Most personalities are established at a very young age and surgical procedures have little influence.
spay.facts.page1.section4=The spayed pet will experience a change in metabolism, a slowing down of the process.  The slowed metabolism may add up to excess weight.  To counter balance the slowed metabolism a number of steps should be taken, individually or in combination.  These steps include a reduced total food volume intake (including treats), possibly changing to a diet dog food (the total volume of food usually is constant but the caloric content is greatly reduced), and a program of regular increased exercise.
spay.facts.page1.section5=Preparation for the surgery is usually begun the day before by the owner.  The patient begins a fast the afternoon prior to surgery.  Provide water or milk for the pet, but all solid foods should be withheld.
spay.facts.page1.section6=Upon arriving at the clinic the patient will be given a complete physical by the admitting Doctor.  The physical will include a check for the heart, lungs, a discussion of the general health observed by the owner and the present diet.  The findings of the examination will allow the Doctor to determine present health and surgical risk.  At the time of the physical exam any needed vaccinations will be given.  Vaccinations help protect your pet by providing strong resistance to disease.  A preanesthetic tranquilizer will also be given to reduce the anxiety of the pet and to facilitate easier handling.
spay.facts.page1.section7=Surgical preparation begins by shaving hair from the fore and rear legs.  A clear field surrounding the site of the intravenous anesthetic injection is necessary.  As the effects of the injectable anesthetic begin to deepen, the patient is further prepared for surgery.  Gas anesthesia may also be given.  The surgical site is prepared by shaving all hair from the abdominal area.  The field is then thoroughly scrubbed with a disinfectant soap and a surgical disinfectant is applied.
spay.facts.page2.count=4
spay.facts.page2.section1=The uterus of the dog and cat may be visualized as a larger "Y".  The ovaries attach at the very tips of each uterine horn and the body of the uterus brings the two horns together.  A midline incision is made through the skin into the abdominal cavity.  After the uterus has been located, the entire reproductive tract is surgically removed.  The incision is then sutured and anesthesia is ended.  During the surgical procedure the patients' lung and heart functions are constantly monitored.
spay.facts.page2.section2=The patient is allowed to recover in the confines of a kennel.  For the first few hours after surgery patients are still sedated.  24 hours after the surgery most patients are discharged.
spay.facts.page2.section3=Post operative instructions follow common sense.  Begin to control the diet as previously mentioned to prevent excessive weight gain.  Most patients will gradually come to a level of activity comfortable for their own desires.  Excessive attention to the surgical site should be gently discouraged.  Stitches will be removed in approximately seven days after the surgery.
spay.facts.page2.section4=If you have any questions please feel free to call the office.

vaccination.canine.date=Date:
vaccination.canine.page=1
vaccination.canine.page1.count=30
vaccination.canine.page1.section1=The first milk puppies receive contains antibodies for protection against disease.  These maternal antibodies gradually decline in a few weeks leaving the puppy vulnerable.  In order for the puppy to develop their own antibodies, they must either be vaccinated or be exposed to the disease organism.  Vaccination is preferred because some diseases are fatal and others, even with appropriate treatment, may produce symptoms that last for life.  Ironically, the maternal antibodies can also interfere with the puppy's response to the vaccine.  Therefore, a series of scheduled vaccinations, starting at six to eight weeks of age, is part of the puppy's preventative health program.  Vaccines contain a deactivated form of a virus or bacteria that will not transmit the disease, but will stimulate the immune system to produce protective antibodies.  Typically, they assure effective disease protection in over 95% of vaccinated animals.  However, there is no guarantee that 100% of the vaccinated animals will receive adequate protection.  This is due to the variation with different animal's immune systems and not the effectiveness of the vaccine.  High antibody levels are maintained in adults through re-vaccination.

vaccination.canine.page1.section5=1. Canine Distemper
vaccination.canine.page1.section6=Canine distemper is a contagious viral disease seen most frequently in puppies.  It affects multiple organ systems.  Early clinical signs include fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, conjunctivitis and nasal discharge.  Symptoms progress to discharge from the eyes, a more severe nasal discharge, diarrhea, pneumonia, convulsions and sometimes paralysis.  Puppies that recover from the initial infection often develop seizures and other neurologic symptoms.  The mortality rate is very high.
vaccination.canine.page1.section7=
vaccination.canine.page1.section8=2. Infectious Canine Hepatitis
vaccination.canine.page1.section9=Infectious canine hepatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects the liver.  Early signs are similar to those seen with canine distemper.  Sometimes respiratory signs are also seen.  The disease is transmitted through body fluids including urine and feces.
vaccination.canine.page1.section10=
vaccination.canine.page1.section11=3. Leptospirosis
vaccination.canine.page1.section12=Leptospirosis is a zoonotic (transmissible from animals to man) bacterial disease affecting domestic and wild animals.  There are several different species (serovars) and immunity to one serovar does not give protection to other serovars.  The disease is transmitted by infected body fluids that contact the skin, mucous membrane or eye.  Clinical signs include fever, jaundice, bloody feces and depression.  The disease primarly affects the liver and kidneys.  Animals that respond to treatment can shed the organism in their urine for several weeks after recovery.

vaccination.canine.page1.section15=Canine parvovirus is a very contatious virus spread by contact with body fluids from an affected animal.  The virus can remain viable in the environment for several days during warm and humid conditions.  Clinical signs include fever, severe vomiting and bloody diarrhea, depression, and dehydration.  Occasionally the heart muscle is also affected.  The virus also suppresses the immune system making the animal susceptible to secondary bacterial infection.  The mortality rate can be very high.

vaccination.canine.page1.section17=5. Canine Coronavirus
vaccination.canine.page1.section18=Canine coronavirus affects the stomach and intestines.  It most frequently affects puppies.  Clinical signs include diarrhea, vomiting and depression, however, these signs are less severe than those caused by canine parvovirus and the mortality rate is much lower.
vaccination.canine.page1.section19=
vaccination.canine.page1.section20=6. Canine Respiratory Tract Infection
vaccination.canine.page1.section21=This disease syndrome sometimes referred to as infectious tracheobronchitis or kennel cough.  The predominant clinical sign is a harsh frequently nonproductive cough that mimics a honking sound followed by a gagging response.  Rarely does pneumonia develop.  The disease is highly contagious and spread through inhalation of infected upper respiratory secretions.  Some of the viruses and bacteria assocated with this condition are listed below.
vaccination.canine.page1.section22=
vaccination.canine.page1.section23=6a. Canine Adenovirus Type 2
vaccination.canine.page1.section24=Canine adenovirus type 2 affects the cells tht line the respiratory tract.  Clinical signs often include a dry, hacking cough that may lead to pneumonia.

vaccination.canine.page1.section26=6b. Canine Parainfluenza Virus
vaccination.canine.page1.section27=Canine parainfluenza virus is frequently found in the upper respiratory tract of dogs.  Clinical signs associated with this virus include a mild cough and runny nose.
vaccination.canine.page1.section28=
vaccination.canine.page1.section29=7. Rabies     
vaccination.canine.page1.section30=Rabies is petentially fatal zoonatic viral infection affecting the central nervous system.  The virus is transmitted by infected saliva that comes in contact with the conjunctiva of the eye, mucous membraines, and abraded skin, or through bite wounds.

vaccination.feline.page1.section1=The first milk kittens receive contains antibodies for protection agains disease.  These maternal antibodies gradually decline in a few weeks leaving the kitten vulnerable.  In order for the kitten to develop their own antibodies, they need to be vaccinated or be exposed to the disease organism.  Vaccination is preferred because some diseases are fatal and others, even with appropriate treatment, may produce symptoms that last for life.  Ironically, the maternal antibodies can also interfere with the kitten's response to the vaccine.  Therefore, a series of scheduled vaccinations, starting at six to eight weeks of age, is part of the kitten's preventative health program.  Vaccines contain a deactivated form of a virus or bacteria that will not transmit the disease, but will stimulate the immune system to produce protective antibodies.  Typically, they assure effective disease protection in over 95% of vaccinated animals.  However, there is no guarantee that 100% of the vaccinated animals will receive adequate protection.  This is due to the varation with different animal's immune systems and not the effectiveness of the vaccine.  High antibody levels are maintained in adults through revaccination.

vaccination.feline.page1.section5=1. Feline Panleukopenia
vaccination.feline.page1.section6=Feline panleukopenia is a viral disease frequently referred to as feline distemper.  It is highly contagious and frequently affects kittens.  Clinical signs include fever, loss of appetite, vomitting, depression, diarrhea, and dehydration.  Surviving animals may become carriers and she the virus.  The mortality rate is high.
vaccination.feline.page1.section7=
vaccination.feline.page1.section8=2. Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis
vaccination.feline.page1.section9=Feline viral rhinotracheitis is highly contagious affecting the upper respiratory tract.  Clinical signs include moderate fever, excessive discharge from the eyes and nose, sneezing, coughing, and open mouth breathing.  There is no cure.  Treatment is symptomatic.  Recovered animals become carriers for life.  Relapses of the clinical signs are frequent and often are induced by stress.
vaccination.feline.page1.section10=
vaccination.feline.page1.section11=3. Feline Calicivirus
vaccination.feline.page1.section12=Feline calicivirus primarily affects the upper respiratory tract and is highly contagious.  Different strains of this virus account for the severity of the clinical signs.  Clinical signs are similar to the feline rhinotracheitis but less severe.  Ulcers of the tongue associated with excessive salivation frequently occur.  Recovered cats become carriers of the virus for life.
vaccination.feline.page1.section13=
vaccination.feline.page1.section14=4. Feline Chlamydiosis
vaccination.feline.page1.section15=Feline chlamydiosis is a very contagious upper respiratory disease primarily affecting kittens.  Clinical signs include conjunctivitis, ocular and nasal discharge, sneezing, and coughing.  Sometimes the conjunctivitis becomes a chronic condition.  Treatment involves a prolonged use of antibiotics.
vaccination.feline.page1.section16=
vaccination.feline.page1.section17=5. Feline Leukemia
vaccination.feline.page1.section18=Feline leukemia is a viral disease primarily spread by contact with saliva and nasal secretions.  It also can be transmitted by contaminated food and water sources.  Numerous organs are affected, primarily those of the immune system.  Clinical signs frequently seen include weight loss, anemia, increased susceptibility to infectious diseases.  The disease primarily occurs in multipe cat households or in feral cats.  Testing is available to determine if the cat has been exposed to the virus.  Humans can not contract leukemia from this virus.
vaccination.feline.page1.section19=
vaccination.feline.page1.section20=6. Feline Immunodeficiency Virus
vaccination.feline.page1.section21=Feline immunodeficiency virus is a highly contatious, usually fatal disease.  It is most common in adult males and is primarily spred through bite wounds.  There is no cure for the disease but there are tests available to see if the cat has been exposed to the disease.  Death is due to secondary infections.  Humans can not contract this virus.
vaccination.feline.page1.section22=
vaccination.feline.page1.section23=7. Feline Infectious Peritonitis
vaccination.feline.page1.section24=Feline infectious peritonitis is a viral disease most often seen in cats less than two years old.  Clinical signs are progressive once they appear.  The most common signs include muscle wasting, weight loss, weakness and fluid accumulation in the abdomen.  There is no cure for the disease.  The method of transmissions is not known.
vaccination.feline.page1.section25=
vaccination.feline.page1.section26=8. Rabies
vaccination.feline.page1.section27=Rabies is a potentially fatal zoonotic (transmissable from animals to humans) viral disease affecting the central nervous system.  The virus is spread by infected saliva that comes in contact with the conjunctiva of the eye, mucous membranes, and abraded skin, or through bite wounds.
